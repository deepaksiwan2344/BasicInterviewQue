//Asymtotic Notation
//What is Asymptotic Notation?
//time complexity depend on input


//Asymptotic gives a high-level understanding of algorithm performance.




//There are three common notations used for asymptotic analysis:

 //Note:Worst-case performance	
// 1. Big O Notation (O): Big O notation describes the upper bound or worst-case behavior of an
// algorithm. It provides an upper limit on the growth rate of the algorithm's resource usage
//  (e.g., time or space) as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with a time
//  complexity of O(n) means that the algorithm's runtime grows linearly with the input size.

//Note: Best-case performance	
// 2.Omega Notation (Ω): Omega notation describes the lower bound or best-case behavior of an algorithm.
//  It provides a lower limit on the growth rate of the algorithm's resource usage. For example,
//  an algorithm with a time complexity of Ω(n^2) means that the algorithm's runtime grows at
//   least quadratically with the input size.

//Note: Average or exact performance	
// 3.Theta Notation (Θ):
// By using asymptotic notation, you can make informed decisions about algorithm selection and 
// optimize your code for better performance.
