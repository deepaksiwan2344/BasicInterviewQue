//Complexity

// Complexity in algorithms refers to the analysis and measurement of the resources 
// required by an algorithm to solve a problem

//TimeComplexity
// Time Complexity: Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes 
// to run as a function of the input size.


// It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time grows with larger inputs.
// For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that the running 
// time increases quadratically with the input size.


// Ω(1): Best case
// O(n): Worst case
// Theta (Θ) Average case,
