//Complexity

// Complexity in algorithms refers to the analysis and measurement of the resources 
// required by an algorithm to solve a problem

//TimeComplexity

// Time Complexity: Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes 
// to run as a function of the input size.


// It helps us understand how the algorithm's running time grows with larger inputs.

// For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) means that the running 
// time increases quadratically with the input size.
