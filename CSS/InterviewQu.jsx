CSS3 is more faster with compare to CSS

1. What is CSS and why is it used?
Answer:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements—such as layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
It separates content (HTML) from presentation, improving maintainability and design flexibility.

2. What are the different types of CSS?
Answer:

Inline CSS – written inside an HTML element using the style attribute.

Internal CSS – written inside a <style> tag within the <head> section.

External CSS – written in a separate .css file and linked using <link>.

3. What is the Box Model in CSS?
Answer:
The Box Model consists of:

Content – the actual text or image.

Padding – space between content and border.

Border – a line surrounding the element.

Margin – space outside the border (between elements).

4. What is the difference between class and id selectors in CSS?
Answer:

#id targets an element with a specific ID (must be unique).

.class targets one or multiple elements with the same class.

5. What is the difference between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning in CSS?
Answer:

relative: Moves relative to its normal position.

absolute: Positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

fixed: Stays fixed relative to the viewport.

sticky: Switches between relative and fixed depending on scroll position.


6. What is the difference between em, rem, px, and % units in CSS?
Answer:

px – absolute pixel size.

em – relative to the parent's font-size.

rem – relative to the root (html) font-size.

% – relative to the parent element's size.

8. How is visibility: hidden different from display: none?
Answer:

display: none: Element is removed from the layout (takes no space).

visibility: hidden: Element is invisible but still occupies space.


9. What is a pseudo-class in CSS?
Answer:
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.
