// ðŸ’¡Why OOP is Important in Programming:

/*
OOP is important because it helps you write clean, scalable, reusable, and maintainable code, 
especially in large applications.


1.Code Reusability (Inheritance);
2.Encapsulation (Data Protection);
3.Polymorphism (Same Interface, Different Behavior);
4.Abstraction (Hide Complexity);
Modular & Maintainable Code

Each class/module handles one thing. It's easy to:

Fix bugs
Add new features
Understand the code

Summary:
Abstraction:	Hides complexity
Encapsulation:  Protects data
Inheritance:	Reuses code
Polymorphism:	Improves flexibility

When is OOP Useful?

Building large apps
Team projects where clear structure is needed
Systems like e-commerce, banking, games, CMS, etc.
