//Difference between Library and Framework

//In Framework Library can be use but in Library Framework can not be used so, 
//In React js Angular is not used but in Angular React js is used.


// In summary, libraries provide specific functionality that developers can use
// to solve particular problems, whereas frameworks provide a complete structure 
// and set of tools for building applications.
