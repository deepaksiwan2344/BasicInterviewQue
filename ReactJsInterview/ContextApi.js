//ContextApi

// Context API is a feature in React that allows for global state management and provides a 
//way to share data 
// between components without passing props explicitly through the component tree. 

//Context API consists of two main parts:
//1.Context Provider
//2.Context Consumer


  //Context Provider: The Provider is used to wrap the parent component that will provide the context data 
  // and consumer is used in child components that need access to the context data. 
// The Consumer component is typically used when a component needs to access data from 
// a context


// Provider component is used to pass data down the component tree to child components 
// that need access to it. The Provider component is created using the createContext 
// function, which returns an object with two properties: Provider and Consumer.
