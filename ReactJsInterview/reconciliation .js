// what is reconciliation  in React js

//In React.js, reconciliation is the process by which React compares the current 
//state of a component's rendered output with its previous state and determines 
//if any changes need to be made to the actual DOM.



//Overall, reconciliation is a core mechanism in React that allows for 
//efficient rendering and updating of components, enabling fast and responsive 
//user interfaces.
