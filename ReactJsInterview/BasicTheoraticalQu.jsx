// Beginner-Level Questions
// What is React?
// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It uses a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient updates.

// What are components in React?
// Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI in a React app. They can be functional or class-based.

// What is JSX?
// JSX is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Itâ€™s used with React to describe UI structure.

// What is the virtual DOM?
// A virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to determine the most efficient way to update the UI.

// What are props in React?
// Props are inputs passed from a parent to a child component, used to customize and control behavior.

// What is state in React?
// State is a local data storage that is mutable and managed within a component.

// What is the difference between props and state?
// Props are read-only and passed from parent to child; state is internal and can be updated.

// What is a functional component?
// A function that returns JSX and does not use lifecycle methods or local state (before hooks).

// What is a class component?
// A component defined using ES6 classes that can use state and lifecycle methods.

// What is a pure component?
// A component that does a shallow comparison of props and state to prevent unnecessary renders.


// ðŸ”¹ Intermediate-Level Questions
// What are hooks in React?
// Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

// What is useState?
// A hook that lets you add state to a functional component.

// What is useEffect?
// A hook for performing side effects (e.g., data fetching, subscriptions).

// What is useRef?
// A hook used to access and persist values across renders or interact with the DOM.

// What is useContext?
// A hook that allows a component to subscribe to React context.

// What is lifting state up?
// Moving state to a common parent so it can be shared between child components.

// What is prop drilling?
// Passing props through multiple levels of components unnecessarily.

// What is the Context API?
// A way to pass global data (like themes or auth) without prop drilling.

// What is conditional rendering?
// Rendering different UI elements based on conditions (e.g., if, ternary operator).

// What is an event in React?
// A synthetic wrapper around native browser events used in React components.

// ðŸ”¹ Advanced-Level Questions
// What is reconciliation in React?
// The process of comparing the current and previous virtual DOM to update the real DOM efficiently.

// What is the role of keys in React lists?
// Keys help React identify which items have changed or been added/removed.

// What are fragments in React?
// A way to return multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

// What is memoization?
// A performance optimization technique to cache the result of expensive calculations.

// What is React.memo?
// A higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the component.

// What is useMemo?
// A hook that memoizes a computed value between renders.

// What is useCallback?
// A hook that memoizes a function between renders.

// What is a higher-order component (HOC)?
// A function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component.

// What is lazy loading in React?
// Loading components only when needed using React.lazy.

// What is Suspense in React?
// A component that allows waiting for something before rendering (usually used with React.lazy).

// ðŸ”¹ Performance Optimization
// How to optimize React app performance?
// Use memoization (useMemo/useCallback), lazy loading, React.memo, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

// What is code splitting?
// Breaking the app into smaller bundles to load only whatâ€™s needed.

// How to prevent re-renders?
// Use React.memo, PureComponent, and proper key usage.

// What is a controlled component?
// A form input where the value is controlled by React via state.

// What is an uncontrolled component?
// A form input that maintains its own state using the DOM.

// What is forwardRef?
// A React API that allows a parent component to access a childâ€™s ref.

// How to handle forms in React?
// Use controlled inputs with onChange handlers and useState.

// What is the difference between BrowserRouter and HashRouter?
// BrowserRouter uses the HTML5 history API; HashRouter uses the URL hash for navigation.

// What is useImperativeHandle?
// A hook used with forwardRef to expose specific methods to parent components.

// What is debounce in React?
// A technique to delay execution of a function after a pause in input events.

// ðŸ”¹ Testing and Ecosystem
// How to test React components?
// Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

// What is Enzyme?
// A testing utility for React that provides shallow rendering and component introspection.

// What is React Testing Library?
// A library for testing React components by simulating user interactions.

// What is Redux?
// A state management library for JavaScript applications.

// What are actions in Redux?
// Plain JavaScript objects that describe an event in the app.

// What are reducers in Redux?
// Functions that handle actions and update the state accordingly.

// What is the Redux store?
// The centralized state container in a Redux application.

// Difference between Redux and Context API?
// Redux is more powerful and suited for complex state management, while Context API is simpler and built-in.

// What is redux-thunk?
// A middleware that allows writing async logic that interacts with the store.

// What is the use of useSelector and useDispatch in Redux?
// useSelector accesses state from the store; useDispatch sends actions to the store.
