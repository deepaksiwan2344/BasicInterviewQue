//basically jsx is the extention of javascript and with the help of jsx we can write 
//html,css code in javascript.

//jsx is not a regular javascript object and Bable convert the jsx into regular javascript 
//object so we can read html in javascript


// In the context of JSX, Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler that is often used to
// transform JSX syntax into regular JavaScript code that can be understood and executed
// by browsers and JavaScript runtimes.

// 1. Why use className in place of class in React js
// class is a reserved keyword in  jsx used to defined classes so React uses className to avoid confusion and maintain valid 
// javascript syntax

// 2. what is babel?
//Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to write modern JavaScript (like ES6, ES7, JSX, etc.)
//and have it transformed into older JavaScript that can run in all browsers, including older ones.

 //What Babel Does:
 //Transforms JSX to JavaScript (for React).
 //Converts ES6+ syntax to ES5.
 //Adds polyfills for missing features via plugins.
