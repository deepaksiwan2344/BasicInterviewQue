// In React.js, a pure component is a class component that only re-renders
//  when its props or state changes. It implements the shouldComponentUpdate 
//  lifecycle method to perform a shallow comparison of the incoming props and
//  state with the current props and state to determine if re-rendering is 
//  necessary. Pure components are useful for optimizing performance by
//  reducing unnecessary re-renders.
